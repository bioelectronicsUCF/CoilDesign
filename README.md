The repository provides the design automation program for wireless power coils.
The program is written in Matlab app designer and the algorithm is based on k-oriented design methodology [1].
The program is under development and takes few minutes to run.

The repository also includes scripts for automation of HFSS simulation written in IronPython and Linux bash.
Simulation data and Matlab codes to generate figures of the manuscript is also included.
